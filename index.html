            <p><span class="first-character sc">W</span>e remember the youth of 1976 and what transpired on the day. Youth Day, 
                as it is popularly known, is a day in which South Africans honour the youth that was ambushed by the apartheid regime 
                police in Soweto on 16 June 1976. On the day, over 500 young people, including school students, were killed.</p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">On the morning of 16 June 1976, thousands of black students from Soweto in the then Transvaal, now Gauteng, went on a protest rally from their schools to Orlando Stadium.<br>
                While black students were already getting conscientised by student organisations and the Black Consciousness Movement when the Bantu Education Act (1953) was instituted, they 
                mobilised for a protest against an official order that made Afrikaans - along side English only - as the medium of instruction compulsory in black township schools throughout 
                the country. The use of African languages was prohibited in these schools and the Constitution supported Afrikaans and English to be made the official languages of the country. <br>
                The rally was a peaceful protest intended to urge the government not to make Afrikaans compulsory in schools. <br>
                But when armed police were called in to disperse the crowds with dogs, teargas and bullets, they opened fire on the students. The protest turned into an uprising by students against 
                the apartheid government, but hundreds of students were killed by police. And <a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/june-16-soweto-youth-uprising" target="_blank">so the 1976 student uprising</a>, as it was called, was born.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character ny">B</span>The events of the day highlight a few individuals who took part in the protest. Among the first children killed was 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu, 
                and 12-year-old Hector Pieterson. We also remember Tsietsi Mashinini, who lead the students in protest
            </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"><h4>Hector Pieterson</h4>
                Hector was one of the first casualties of the 1976 uprising. He was killed by a shot fired directly at him, contrary to police claims that he was killed by a bullet "ricocheting off the ground". Pieterson was rushed to a nearby clinic where he was pronounced dead. He was 12 at the time of his death.<br>
                The Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum was later opened in Soweto near the place where he was shot in Orlando West, on 16 June 2002. This was done in the honour of Hector and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising.
            </p>
            <p class="margin-top-10"><h4>Hastings Ndlovu</h4>
                Although the media reports named Hector as the first child to die on 16 June 1976, Hastings Ndlovu was in fact the first child to be shot according to police records. Ndlovu's death did not become as iconic as Hector's because no photographer was present to record it and his name was not immediately known.

            <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he aftermath of the events of June 16, 1976, had dire consequences for the Apartheid government. 
                Images of the police firing on peacefully demonstrating students led an international revulsion against South Africa as its brutality was exposed. Meanwhile, the weakened and exiled liberation movements 
                received new recruits fleeing political persecution at home giving impetus to the struggle against Apartheid. </p>
            <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
            <p class="margin-top-10">This year marks the 46th anniversary of the 16 June 1976 student uprising in Soweto when young people protested against imposition of Afrikaans by the apartheid regime as a medium of instruction. The uprising ended tragically with hundreds of young people being brutally killed. 
                Following the advent of democracy in 1994, the new democratic government declared 16 June as National Youth Day and June as the Youth Month. The declaration honours of the contribution of the youth in the struggle for the liberation of South Africa.</p>
